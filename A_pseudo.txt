Goal?
We want to create a Timer, using HTML, CSS, JS.

What is a Timer?
A set time (minutes/seconds), that decrements down to 1:00 minutes.

Additional Features?
INITIALLY:
  Show Time as 1:00 minutes
  Start button
AFTER:
  Show Time while counting down to 0:00 minutes
  Pause
  Stop

How we would go about coding (language-less)?
- set a variable/value to 60 seconds (1 minute)
  - 00:60
- decrement the timer by 00:01 (1 second) every second once the user clicks "start"
- pause the timer once the user clicks "pause"
- and reset the timer to 
- show the decrementing Timer on screen

VERSIONS:
Level 0: Just showcasing a Timer on the screen (via HTML/CSS) 00:60 seconds
Level 1: Have the Timer on the screen, start counting down when reloaded
Level 2: Have a button "start", that links with starting the countdown
Level 3: Have "pause" and "stop" buttons that appear after countdown started
Level 4: Introduce additional time to timer (meaning minutes) <math converstion>
Level 5: Allow user to set time, or click buttons to choose Timer limit

HTML:
0 - empty div with classname called 'timer'
2 - button named as 'start'
3 - buttons named 'pause' and 'stop' (hidden until start is initiated)
5 - additional buttons or textfield to allow user to set time

JS:
0 - set variable to 60, show
1 -
  window.onLoad (runs a function)
    built in function set interval (for 1000ms)
      set a value to 60
      show that value decrementing by 1 until 0
